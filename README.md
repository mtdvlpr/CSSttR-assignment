# CSSttR-assignment

## Week 1 - My Plan

### Assignment

I want to create a control panel. I have the following ideas:

- Retro Arcade Console: A screen with a joystick and buttons. Control the game.
- Smart Home Hub: The inside of a house and a control panel. Control lights, thermostat, etc.

### CSS Techniques

I want to at least use the following CSS techniques:

- CSS nesting
- style queries

### Challenges

CSS in general is a challenge for me. Especially creating something visually appealing.

## Week 2 - Design

I have decided to go with the Retro Arcade Console, because I think it will be more fun and also challenging.

I started with just a box with a square that can be controlled with a d-pad.

## Week 3 - Development

I created the arcade console around the screen and made the player a pacman, but I had some trouble getting the 3D effects right.

The rest of the week, I was unable to work on the assignment, due to personal circumstances, so I've got some work to do.

## Week 4 - Final work

I made the button in the arcade style and got the 3D working.
